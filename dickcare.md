# PSA for all dick-owners

## For your own health and social acceptability
 - Wash at least semi-frequently, preferably daily.
 - Whenever you wash, wash your dick, especially the head.
 - Washing is not just running water over it, use your hands, it's not like you
   don't touch yourself anyway. And avoid soap, or anything else you wouldn't
   put in your mouth, it's about that easy to damage.
 
## For anyone who has to deal with your dick in any way
 - Wash daily.
 - When going to the toilet, pull back foreskin, pee, wipe tip, return foreskin.
 - If you experience "dripping" after going to the toilet, squeeze the urethra
   stem to tip before wiping.
