In 2014, [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A)
gave a talk in which he had a stab at what the future might hold, which can be
found [here](https://youtu.be/_kBlH-DQsEg). For those who don't like watching
talks, I've written an edited transcript below.

2030: Privacy's Dead. What happens next?
=========================================
So on the very first talk today Warren Ellis said that predicting the future was
a mug's game. So, there's been enough history today; let's try and predict the
future. 

You don't really notice change happening. Google was incorporated 16
years ago, yesterday, 1998. The easy access to information that it ushered in
changed the world. And sure, if it hadn't been Brin and Page, it would've been
someone else with a similar algorithm. But can you imagine taking someone from
1996, nevermind Victorian times, just 1996, and showing them today: a small
magical device in your pocket that can answer 99% of all your questions about
the world and 99% of all your requests for media, *but* that constantly reports
your location to the police so they can look you up if they need to. And then
you've got any number of instant ways of communicating with nearly anyone in the
world -- all of which is monitored all the time by shadowy government agencies.
