## In response to Isaac Asimov on creativity

Isaac Asimov once wrote a [quite thoughtful piece](

) on how to stimulate the formation of new ideas. If you haven't read it yet, I
highly recommend it.

### On the contents of Asimov's essay
Asimov makes several observations and recommendations, mostly in the vein of
reducing pressure, enabling knowledge-sharing, and, crucially, making sure
people feel free to form and share their own thoughts (explicitly pointing out
several failure modes). Common themes seem to be a perspective on facts as "raw
ingredients for discovery" and the necessity of a relaxed atmosphere for
discovery.

Another sense I get from Asimov, though I don't see it written out explicitly in his
essay, is that serendipity is essential. Someone, somewhere, might be capable of
"connecting the dots", but you can't know who, nor what dots need connecting
(else, they'd be connected already). Or, conversely, any given person
might be able to connect dots in an interesting fashion, but you can't know what
dots that specific person might be able to connect. Therefore, it is advised to
give them as many dots as possible, and then leave them free to try and connect
them however they wish. 

### Useful interactions
Asimov seems to recommend a mix of isolation and meeting sessions. While his
arguments for both are sound, I think breaking meetings up in sessions walks
into the trap he himself describes as lethal: it creates pressure. Somehow,
meetings should achieve an unforced interaction pattern.

One interaction I noticed recently was
