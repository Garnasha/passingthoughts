This is an archived draft of a post replying to someone used to common law
contracts, explaining why an unconditional consent form isn't as scary
in France as it seems to be in America. No guarantee is given about its
accuracy, only that this was roughly what popped into my head when thinking
about the subject.

-----------------------------------------------

I think in Europe in general, the consent form is void if the doctor grossly violates reasonable expectations.

There is a general view in European philosophy of ethics and law that some rights cannot be signed away. Some not under normal circumstances, some not ever. Among those are certain forms and levels of control over yourself and that which is closest to you.

Also, judges here seem less literalist in their interpretation of the law, and have some emotional investment in the proper use of law (including contracts). It's usually really hard to get a judge to take offence, but it's easy to do by abusing the law. If you write an "evil" contract, and it ever produces unreasonable results, it'll get taken very seriously, in a sense... The first judge to see it will probably rule it unlawful, and then hear the rest of the case in which it was brought up with little inclination to interpret the law favourably for the writer.

Since judges do a lot of interpreting, generally with the aim of providing the best outcomes for everyone involved and society at large, losing a judge's goodwill is generally a Bad Idea.

In the end, this means that contracts are either written reasonably, used
reasonably, or won't be enforced as they are written. Some contracts here sound
draconian but are generally a formality, only meant to guard against flagrant
violations, in other cases getting adjudicated to satisfy proportionality. So
yeah, often, contracts are more like guidelines, not actual rules.
